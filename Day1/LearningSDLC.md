# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Introduction
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. It aims to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

## SDLC Models

### 1. Waterfall Model
The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next phase begins. It is one of the oldest and most straightforward SDLC models.

#### Phases:
- **Requirement Analysis**
- **System Design**
- **Implementation**
- **Integration and Testing**
- **Deployment**
- **Maintenance**

### 2. V-Model (Verification and Validation)
The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall Model. It emphasizes verification and validation processes, with each development phase having a corresponding testing phase.

#### Phases:
- **Requirement Analysis** ↔ **Acceptance Testing**
- **System Design** ↔ **System Testing**
- **Architectural Design** ↔ **Integration Testing**
- **Module Design** ↔ **Unit Testing**
- **Coding**

### 3. Iterative Model
The Iterative Model focuses on an initial, simplified implementation that progressively gains complexity and a broader feature set until the final system is complete. Each iteration involves planning, design, coding, and testing.

#### Phases:
- **Planning**
- **Design**
- **Implementation**
- **Testing**
- **Evaluation**

### 4. Big Bang Model
The Big Bang Model is a high-risk SDLC model that does not follow a specific process. Developers start with little to no planning and work on coding and development until the project is complete.

#### Characteristics:
- **No formal process**
- **High risk of failure**
- **Suitable for small projects or experimental software**

### 5. Spiral Model
The Spiral Model combines iterative development with the systematic aspects of the Waterfall Model. It emphasizes risk analysis and iterative refinement through multiple cycles (spirals).

#### Phases:
- **Planning**
- **Risk Analysis**
- **Engineering**
- **Evaluation**

### 6. Agile Model
The Agile Model promotes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. It focuses on delivering small, functional pieces of software quickly and continuously improving them based on user feedback.

#### Subtypes:
- **Scrum**: Uses sprints (short, time-boxed periods) to complete specific tasks. Roles include Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.
- **Kanban**: Visualizes the workflow using a Kanban board, emphasizing continuous delivery without overburdening the development team.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Focuses on technical excellence and customer satisfaction through frequent releases in short development cycles.
- **Lean**: Aims to optimize efficiency by eliminating waste, improving quality, and delivering faster.

Choosing the right model depends on the project's requirements, complexity, and goals.git
